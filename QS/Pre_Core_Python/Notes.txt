For Loop :
It is a looping statement which is use to execute a set of instruction again and again by traversing through each and every element of the collection.
In case of for loop initilization and the updatation of looping variable is not required. This are optional or automated.

For loop we know how many times the iteration and while we do not know. Eg - palindrome, armstrong number (whithout type casting)


Range Function :
It is a built in Function which is use to generate the sequence of numbers in between the user entered limits.
Since the elements generatated files in function is not having any structure we cannot display there.
If we need to display we have to make use of a concept of type casting.(list,tuple)
To iterate through the range collection type casting is not required.
