## Success Checklist

- [ ] **Week 1**: Python fundamentals mastered, CLI utility completed
- [ ] **Week 2**: OOP concepts understood, class-based design implemented
- [ ] **Week 3**: Recursion & tree traversals mastered, visualizer working
- [ ] **Week 4**: Sorting algorithms implemented and visualized
- [ ] **Week 5**: Dynamic programming problems solved efficiently
- [ ] **Week 6**: Full-stack project deployed, interview questions practiced

## Key Reminders

1. **Track Progress**: Check off completed items at the end of each week
2. **Reflect Daily**: Use your 30-minute wrap-up to identify gaps and plan the next day
3. **Build As You Learn**: Each mini-project reinforces the week's learning objectives
4. **Stay Consistent**: Six weeks of focused work + regular reviews = real momentum
